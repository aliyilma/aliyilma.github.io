[`This is a Linkedin post reflection`](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7217967999973019650)

Two years ago, for my master's thesis and a forthcoming article, I focused on pedestrian behavior and dynamics, marking videos taken from high floors frame by frame and analyzing them with my limited programming knowledge.Â 
Nowadays, I wondered if I could go back to this work and go over it again with new techniques. Especially considering the momentum in the last two years, I have attempted this work again with image processing techniques that I think have become easier. The result I have seen is that the machine learning techniques that have become easier to use have also brought bigger challenges. It took a lot of time to prepare the dataset, implement it, train the model and process the outputs. But still, I am really happy with the results.

Pedestrian arteries of Istanbul

Highways and connected streets that dominated by vehicles come to mind when "main arteries of the city" is mentioned. But without use value these discourses are incomplete. With the mapping of POI dataset published recently by Overture Maps Foundation, it is seen that the points where the citizens interact are clustered and connected in various forms in some regions. Perhaps it is time to supplement mobility and morphological inferences with daily life dynamics. Cities are not uniform machines as shown on flat maps, but rather organisms where many layers operate synchronously.

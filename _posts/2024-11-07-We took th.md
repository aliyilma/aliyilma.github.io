[`This is a Linkedin post reflection`](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7260224155218792448)

We took the stage at ASC2024 with six presentations under the session ‘Post-Disaster Urban Resilience and Risk Mitigation’. I had the pleasure of presenting the ones on the socio-economic impacts of a potential earthquake in Istanbul and a neighborhood-level Natech risk assessment.

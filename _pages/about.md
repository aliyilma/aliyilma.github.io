<div style="text-align: justify">
istanbulite by birth, bursa's past resident, and now back in the vibrant chaos of istanbul. navigated through `urban and regional planning bsc (2018)`, upgraded to `urban design msc (2022)`, and currently embroiled in the thrilling saga of a `phd at ITU` while juggling the roles of a research/teaching wizard in urban and regional planning. my compass points towards unraveling the mysteries of `pedestrian` dance, decoding `spatial data` symphonies, and exploring the `urban macroform`. a part-time geek, always in awe of the spatio-temporal ballet of city life.
